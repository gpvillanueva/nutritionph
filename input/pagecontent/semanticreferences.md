Semantic references

The WHO SMART Guidelines is expected to define up purpose-specific data structures. These can be used as Semantic references - i.e. data elements in the L3 can be mapped to it.

The following are some reference models that can be used.


Criteria: 
* Open, free access specifications
* Availability as a logical (non-physical) data definition


- **HL7 FHIR IPS (International Patient Summary)**: The HL7 FHIR IPS is a FHIR specification designed for sharing patient summaries across international borders.

- **OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)**: Developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative, the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) maps disparate data sources into a consistent model.

- **CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium)**: Provides standards to support the acquisition, exchange, submission, and archival of clinical research data.

- **i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside)**: i2b2 provides a framework for integrating clinical and genomic data, thereby aiding in personalized medicine and research.
